    <h1>Jack Black: A Capstone Project</h1>
    <p><b>Technological details</b></p>
    <p>During the process of my capstone project, a Jack Black game, I explored several techniques and learned some new things. The very first thing I needed to consider was how to track my progress. There were several ways to do it: using a diary or using a version control system. A diary was easy to record notes but hard to record changes in codes. Eventually, I chose a version control system called GitHub because I wanted to track my progress on the code itself. Using a version control system was not easy, I had to build the environment for the system and look up the command for controlling it online. After some learning and preparation, I created my repository and uploaded my first file to it. The next thing I needed to do was choose a coding method. Although I was planning to use JavaScript to build the game, there were two ways to build it. The first way was the traditional way, where the code I wrote could be executed immediately; the second way was a new way, where the code must be compiled to execute. Although the first way seemed to be easier, it would become a mess once there were many codes and dependencies; the second way needed to be compiled, but it could also manage the code and dependencies easier. Therefore, I chose the second way eventually. The second way would require a package manager called NPM, which came from NodeJS. After learning knowledge of NodeJS, I was able to create a demo for my game. Thanks to the package manager, I could easily import dependencies from different sources. Just like what people always say, “Stop trying to reinvent the wheel,” these dependencies not only saved my time but also improved the quality of my project. At this moment, the last thing to do was compile. In order to compile the code so that browser could execute, a tool named parcel was required. I encountered several errors during the installation of this tool. After some research online, I solved the problem and successfully built the code. Now the only thing to do was to develop the actual game.</p>
    <p><b>Game design</b></p>
    <p>This game is a modified version of Black Jack. The difference between the original game and this game is that this game requires 31 points to win; the dealer and player will start with 3 cards. There is a scoreboard on the top right of the page. When the browser restarts, all the data will be reset. </p>
